# Alive-Universe
The Alive Universe mod for Sins of a Solar Empire 2.

Avaliable on Mod.io: https://mod.io/g/sins2/m/alive-universe and the built in mod browser.

To setup and use the mod locally, you'll need to follow the instruction here https://github.com/IroncladGames/tools and how to use Peon.

This mod gives the Vasari phase resonator and the Advent temple of unity the ability to act like the TEC trade port and produce trade ships.

These trade ships produce no trade value and when killed are worth 50 credits.
